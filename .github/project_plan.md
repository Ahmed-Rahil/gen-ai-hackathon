# Project Plan: From Idea to Winning Pitch

`"THIS PAGE IS INCOMPLETE AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO AMEND THIS PAGE AS PER THE NEED"`

This document outlines our strategic timeline. Our immediate and most critical goal is to create a top-tier **Prototype Deck (PPT)**. This is the first gate, and we need to ace it.

## Phase 1: The Pitch Deck (Our Current Focus)

**Goal:** Develop and finalize a compelling presentation that clearly communicates our vision, technical approach, and potential impact.

| Task ID | Task Description                          | Owner(s)     | Status        | Notes                                                                  |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------- | :----------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1.1** | **Finalize Problem Statement**            | All          | ðŸ’¬ Discussing | Let's confirm "Demystifying Legal Docs" or pivot to another idea.      |
| **1.2** | **Brainstorm Core Features & USPs**       | All          | ðŸ’¡ Ideating   | What will make our solution stand out? (e.g., risk scoring, Q&A).      |
| **1.3** | **Draft Content for Each Slide**          | All          | To-Do         | Team members can claim slides to draft content based on the template.  |
| **1.4** | **Create UI/UX Mockups**                  | (Volunteer?) | To-Do         | We need a simple visual of what the app will look like for the deck.   |
| **1.5** | **Design Technical Architecture Diagram** | (Volunteer?) | To-Do         | A clear diagram showing the proposed Google Cloud services.            |
| **1.6** | **Consolidate & Refine Deck**             | (Team Lead)  | To-Do         | Assemble all content and visuals into the final `PROTOTYPE_DECK.pptx`. |
| **1.7** | **Final Team Review & Submission**        | All          | To-Do         | One last look before we submit the presentation.                       |

## Phase 2: Prototype & Video (Post-PPT Submission)

**Goal:** Build a working prototype with 2-3 core features and create a 3-minute video demo.
