# How to Contribute to Our Hackathon Project

`"THIS PAGE IS INCOMPLETE AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO AMEND THIS PAGE AS PER THE NEED"`

Welcome to the team! To keep our workflow organized and fast-paced, let's stick to a few simple guidelines.

## ðŸ’¬ Communication is Key

- **Primary Channel:** All real-time discussions, questions, and quick updates should happen in our designated **`Whatsapp Group`**.
- **Ideas & Tasks:** Formal suggestions or task tracking should be done via **GitHub Issues**. If you have an idea for a feature or a change to the plan, create an issue so we can discuss and track it.

## Git & GitHub Workflow

We'll use a simple feature-branching workflow. The `main` branch is our source of truth.

**Step 1: Create a Branch**
Before you start working on something, create a new branch from the `main` branch. Name it descriptively.

```bash
# Get the latest version of the main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create your new branch
git checkout -b your-name/what-you-are-working-on
# e.g., anjali/draft-slide-content or anjali/fix-readme-typo
```
